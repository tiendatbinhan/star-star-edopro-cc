**Card Name**
Provide a unique and thematic name for your card. It should fit the style and naming conventions of the archetype or series.

**Stats**
Use the appropriate format for the card type. Include only relevant fields.
- Monster:
  `Type(s)/Effect(s)/Attribute/Level (or Rank or Link Rating)/ATK/DEF/Link Markers/Scale`  

  Notes:
  - Link Markers can be written as either arrows (`↙↓→`) or verbose (`Bottom-Left, Bottom, Right`).  
  - For Pendulum Monsters, if the left and right scales are different, write them as: `Scale 1–8`.

  Examples:
  - Fiend/Flip/Effect/EARTH/Level 4/ATK 1800/DEF 1200  
  - Dragon/Link/Effect/DARK/Link-3/ATK 2500/Bottom-Left, Bottom, Right  
  - Spellcaster/Pendulum/Effect/WIND/Level 5/ATK 2000/DEF 1500/Scale 1–8  

- Spell/Trap:
  `<Type>` Spell/Trap  

  Examples:
  - Normal Spell  
  - Continuous Trap  
  - Quick-Play Spell  
  - Counter Trap  

**Card Text**
Describe the card’s effect using standard TCG-style Problem-Solving Card Text (PSCT) formatting. Be clear, balanced, and thematic.

**Reason for Suggestion**
Explain why this card is needed:
- What role does it fill in the archetype?  
- What problem does it solve (e.g., consistency, recovery, removal)?  
- How does it improve gameplay, synergy, or strategic options?
- (Optional) If the archetype has a lore, how does this card contribute to or reflect that lore?
